# Conventional Commits

## The conventional commit message style is another way you can level up your commit messages. The conventional commits structure involves starting your commit message with a specified commit type. Commit types include:

- Feat– feature
- Fix– bug fixes
- Docs– changes to the documentation like README
- Style– style or formatting change
- Perf– improves code performance
- Test– test a feature
- build– changes that affect build system
- Chore– changes to the build process
- ci– Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- hotfix– Similar to fix, used in some projects for emergency fixes or critical bug fixes.
- deprecated– Marks a feature or method as deprecated
- refactor– change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- revert– Reverts a previous commit
- Using the conventional commit method makes it easy for project contributors to filter and search for specific commits, as shown in the example below: Summary: Docs: Fixes typo on in-from-the-depths.md
